Each person should respond in 1 short sentence. Format each message in JSON format as follows: {{\"speaker\": \"Person X\", \"message\": \"Text\", \"timestamp\": \"Time\"}}. Each response should be a single JSON object.


    Requirements: 
    1. Something else that is importatant is the timestamps.  They should be sequential and start with the current time like in the example below. There should be no discernable patterns to the timestamps.  For example, if the current time is 1:44 PM, the timestamps COULD BE 01:44 PM, 02:13 PM, 02:17 PM, 3:00 PM, 4:44 PM, 4:59 PM, etc.
    2. The conversations should have two people talking meaning one person can send multiple messages in a row before the other replies.  Though not all of the time, do this randomly to make it more realistic.
    3. The timestamps should be sequential and start with the current time, with no discernible patterns. Additionally, incorporate random intervals for one person to send multiple messages before the other replies to simulate a more realistic conversation flow.

Pay special attention to the timestamps and the conversation flow.  IMPORTANT TO NOTE:how one person will send multiple messages in a row before the other replies.

Now generate the conversation about {topic} with {num_turns} turns in a JSON format.  You MUST have at least 1 instance where 2 messages in a row where one person sends multiple messages in a row before the other replies.
